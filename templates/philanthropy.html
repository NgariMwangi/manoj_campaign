            <!-- <p class="ftco-animate">Past International Director- LCIF Trustee & G.A.T. C.A. Leader</p> -->

                Servitude is sanctitude for Dr. Manoj.

He has also been involved in establishing the first Lions Eye Bank in Africa and is currently serving as the Vice Chairman of the Lions SightFirst Eye Hospital in Nairobi.
