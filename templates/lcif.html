            <p class="ftco-animate">Every expectation is unrealistic until it is made a spectacular reality through inspiration, hard work and persistence. If every day you are not paying the price to make your dreams come true, then your everyday is a price that you are paying to stop your dreams from coming true. A much cherished dream in his lions leadership ladder that has come true is his prestigious appointment to serve on the Board of Trustees of Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF) as the representative from Constitutional Area VIII Africa, for a 3 year period (2020-2023). The choice to lead is nurtured by the willingness to rise above challenges of life. The effervescent Manoj won't just adapt to the energy in the Boardroom, rather he intends to influence the energy in that room. Being an experienced lion leader who is very passionate and knowledgeable about LCIF, he is upbeat to carry on his contributions to the success of Foundation and also help play a critical role in helping shape the future of LCIF. The generous Manoj asserts that little assistance is better than the largest intention. We have a business plan, a life plan, and a financial plan, how about having a contribution plan too. He will also be on the frontline as a trustee, as they continue their fundraising efforts through Campaign 100, LCIF Empowering Service. A hand loses nothing by holding another's hand. As LCIF is one of the most successful foundations in the world, it always has new opportunities to pursue and new directions in which to move. A true hero isn't measured by the size of his strength, but by the strength of his heart. Being a trustee is a fantastic opportunity to make a real difference to a cause you care about. As a trustee on the Board of the Foundation for the next 3 years, he intends to carry out awareness of the Foundation, help clubs and districts especially in Africa to visualize and implement meaningful projects that can benefit many needy through the support of the Foundation. You are the salt of the earth. But remember that salt is useful when in association, but useless in isolation. He intends to endeavor to foster partnerships that can make our projects and activities bigger with more impact and also be an advocate for the Foundation and help raise funds. Manoj reveals the charisma of the Lions Clubs International Foundation. The LCIF prides itself on its long-standing record of quality projects. Manoj expresses that LCIF stands for quality - effective programs with excellent follow up, efficiency and uniqueness - The only Lions Foundation that serves the entire world. In fact, the Foundation was ranked the numero uno NGO to partner with by The Financial Times. To really change the world, we have to help people change the way they see things. Global betterment is a mental process, not one that requires huge sums of money or a high level of authority. Change has to be psychological. So if you want to see real change, stay persistent in educating humanity on how similar we all are than different. Don't only strive to be the change you want to see in the world, but also help all those around you see the world through commonalities of the heart so that they would want to change with you. This is how humanity will evolve to become better. This is how you can change the world. The language of the heart is mankind's main common language. His vision for LCIF is to clearly make it the global leader in humanitarian services. One who has tasted the elixir of sacrifice is not satisfied by anything but the pursuit of service.


 J.K. Rowling aptly quoted, "We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all of the power we need inside ourselves already." Manoj has been a witness to the magic of LCIF first hand in the last 20 years in many parts of the world, which has really touched his heart. True leaders are like statues, whether it rains or it shines, they never bend their necks to look backwards. They never run away from challenges. He has been involved with the LCIF for more than 20 years and he had the rare opportunity of taking the key lead with the LCIF staff to foster a partnership with the GAVI Foundation 7 years ago to immunize children in Africa. Manoj doesn't subject himself to a leadership that does not break new territories. Rather he believes that it is the job of effective leadership to succeed in landing its limbs on new grounds. He discloses that through this partnership over the last 5 years more than 60 million children in Africa have been vaccinated for Measles and Rubella. He has personally spearheaded 2 vaccination drives in Kenya, where they have vaccinated over 18 million children. Our mind is a wonderful place, people, aspirations, desires & things can walk-in any time, but it takes longer time for ideas to enter, due to the effort and change required to make–up our mind about not only allowing the ideas in our mind, but also implementing it along with others involved in the system. In his 20 years of leadership in lions, he has been instrumental in making many major LCIF funded projects possible in Kenya, including schools, medical centers, sight first projects and support to the physically challenged. He has also been at the forefront of many natural disasters and catastrophes that have taken place in Kenya and Africa which have been supported by LCIF. He has also helped to initiate lions quest programs in 12 African countries. One of his biggest successes for the continent of Africa is the initiation of over 12 lions eye hospitals established in many countries with his leadership and vision. The future is dependent on the decisions you make when in command. One of his triumphs has been building partnerships with the Foundation. Manoj's massive success in each of these endeavours is attributed to his faith, confidence, courage, patience, relentlessness and resiliency. He has again been in the forefront of all these partnerships including the Carter Foundation to fight and eradicate river blindness in Africa, Special Olympics as he helped create partnerships in more than 8 African countries, Johnson and Johnson for the Sight for Kids program, Essilor to help with the Vision for Kids program, Little Hearts U.K to help babies with congenital heart problems, Smile Train to help children with cleft lip correction, Golisano Foundation to help create a Health Inclusion program for their athletes, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for a sanitization program, Aruna Abhey Oswal Foundation to help develop a Cancer Center for children, Breast Cancer Unit for women and an ENT Center for children in Kenya and many other such foundations. He dreams big with no limitations. Playing small because of the fear of failure isn't what his destiny is made of. He has been created to play big and win big. The fortunate Manoj truly owes himself massive success.
