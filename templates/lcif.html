                Dr Manoj Shah has held The Lions Clubs International Foundation at Heart for the Last 20 Years.
                He is a Firm Believer of The Great Impact That The Foundation has been making to the
                Underprivileged around the world. Manoj has been a witness to the magic of LCIF first hand in
                the last 20 years in many parts of the world, which has really touched his heart. True leaders
                are like statues, whether it rains or it shines, they never bend their necks to look backwards.
                They never run away from challenges. He has been involved with the LCIF for more than 20
                years and he had the rare opportunity of taking the key lead with the LCIF staff to foster a
                partnership with the GAVI Foundation 9 years ago to immunize children in Africa.  He discloses
                that through this partnership over the last 5 years more than 60 million children in Africa have
                been vaccinated for Measles and Rubella. He has personally spearheaded 2 vaccination drives
                in Kenya, where they have vaccinated over 18 million children.
            </p>

            <p class="ftco-animate">
                A much cherished dream in his lions leadership ladder that has come true is his prestigious
                appointment to serve on the Board of Trustees of Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF) as
                the representative from Constitutional Area VIII Africa, for a 3 year period (2020-2023). The
                choice to lead is nurtured by the willingness to rise above challenges of life. The effervescent
                Manoj won&#39;t just adapt to the energy in the Boardroom, rather he intends to influence the
                energy in that room. Being an experienced lion leader who is very passionate and
                knowledgeable about LCIF, he is upbeat to carry on his contributions to the success of
                Foundation and also help play a critical role in helping shape the future of LCIF.
            </p>
            <p class="ftco-animate">
                In his over 3 Decades  of leadership in lions, he has been instrumental in making many major
                LCIF funded projects possible in Kenya, including schools, medical centers, sight first projects
                and support to the physically challenged. He has also been at the forefront of many natural
                disasters and catastrophes that have taken place in Kenya and Africa which have been
                supported by LCIF. He has also helped to initiate lions quest programs in 12 African countries.
                One of his biggest successes for the continent of Africa is the initiation of over 12 lions eye
                hospitals established in many countries with his leadership and vision.
            </p>
            <p class="ftco-animate">
                One of his triumphs has been building partnerships with the Foundation. He has again been in
                the forefront of all these partnerships including:
